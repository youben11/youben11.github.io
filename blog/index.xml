      <description>In the IT world, a software product generally goes through a Software Supply Chain, which is basically all the processes and methods used to deliver that product to the customers, itâ€™s a pipeline which mainly starts with planning and development, going through a variable set of other processes like test, build and quality assurance, all that should end up with the deployment phase. All this process requires some libraries, configuration files and maybe other softwares, and it&amp;rsquo;s not that easy to have the same environment at each stage of the pipeline, which may lead to different behaviours in those environments, making the software runs well during testing but may crash in production.</description>
