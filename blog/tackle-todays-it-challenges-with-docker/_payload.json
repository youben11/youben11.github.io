You can think of it as a new way to build softwares by encapsulating all the components of an application by putting them in a standard box, different applications will have different content inside of it, but we want to make sure that those boxes are used the same way, even if they differ in their content, so we add standard buttons on the outside of it (like run and stop) so we can make use of the application that’s inside of the box.
