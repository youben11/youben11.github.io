So the first thing that got into my mind was to construct a valid pointer referencing a private remote tensor since I know its id, this method worked just fine and I was able to get those private tensors, I even started posting on slack about it! Unfortunately, I was running an old version and Trask had already fixed that at that moment and private tensors weren't accessible anymore (another bad news is that slack doesn't have a feature to delete personal messages :/).
